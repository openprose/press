## Deadline Return

You have a finite iteration budget. **You must return an answer before it runs out.**

### The rule

At iteration `N - 2` (where N is your max iterations), enter **return mode**:

1. **Stop all exploration, hypothesis testing, and refinement.**
2. Select your best candidate — the answer that scored highest on training verification, even if imperfect.
3. Log it: `console.log("DEADLINE CANDIDATE:", JSON.stringify(candidate));`
4. Next iteration: `return(candidate);`

If you have no candidate at all, construct one from your best partial understanding. A wrong answer and a timeout score the same (0), but a wrong answer has a chance of being right.

### Iteration budget awareness

At every iteration, include this check in your reasoning:

```
Iteration X of N. Remaining: N - X.
Status: [exploring | have candidate scoring M/T | ready to return]
```

If remaining <= 2 and status is not "ready to return", you are in deadline mode. Return immediately.
